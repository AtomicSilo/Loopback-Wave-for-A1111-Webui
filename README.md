# Loopback-Wave-for-A1111-Webui
Img2img Loopback with Denoise controls over designated frames.

*Disclaimer: I am not the original author of this script. and this is a fork for FizzleDorf first mention of it. This was originally by an anonymous user on 4chan I came across during my early months exploring animations in SD. There is no "official" repo, only the rentry page linked in this README*

Original rentry by anon where you can find the original script: https://rentry.org/sd-loopback-wave

FizzleDorf rentry guide explaining how it works: https://rentry.org/AnimAnon-LoopbackWave

My guide on how to use it from a not so technical perspective, and adding elements on how to interpolate the results in FlowFrames (Free+Paid), Adobe After Effects (Paid), Adobe Express (Free), and DaVinci Resolve (Paid), can be found on Reddit:

Also, attaching here two batch scripts used to renmae the files in the directories or pad them with zero for windows and via Python.


Installation:
Place the script into the A1111 webui Scripts folder. The script will become a selection in the script dropdown. This only works in the img2img tab and also requires an input image to use. Explainations of the settings are in the two links provided above.


I hope you have fun with it! Feel free to fork and edit the code but I will not be accepting PRs unless there is something completely broken that needs to be fixed.
